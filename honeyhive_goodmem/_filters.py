r"""Builds GoodMem metadata filter expressions safely.

GoodMem filters are expressions evaluated server-side, not SQL. Interpolating
a caller's value into one is both a filter-injection hole and a correctness
bug: an ordinary apostrophe produces a malformed expression. This module is
the only place in the package that writes a filter string.

The escaping and casting rules below were verified live against GoodMem
server v1.0.320:

- a literal is single-quoted; ``'`` inside it escapes as ``\'`` and a literal
  backslash as ``\\``. SQL-style ``''`` doubling and double-quoted strings
  are both rejected with HTTP 400.
- a raw newline inside a literal is rejected, so control characters are
  refused here rather than sent.
- ``val()`` yields JSON, so a comparison must cast to the stored type:
  ``TEXT`` for strings, ``NUMERIC`` for numbers, ``BOOLEAN`` for booleans.
  **The cast has to match:** comparing a boolean as ``TEXT`` is accepted with
  HTTP 200 and matches nothing.
